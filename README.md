# üöÄ Elite Alpha Mirror Bot - Production Trading System

**Transform $1K into $1M by mirroring elite wallet trades in real-time via OKX DEX**

## üß† THE CORE STRATEGY

You mirror the trades of elite wallets (deployer wallets and sniper wallets) on OKX DEX within seconds of their actions, but with full safety validation. These wallets aren't random. They're the exact wallets that:

- **Deployed the last 100x‚Äì1000x tokens**
- **Sniped tokens pre-pump before the crowd found them** 
- Have a **track record of turning $500 into $500K within minutes**

You aren't guessing. You're letting **history-proven smart money lead you**. Your only job is to **watch them like a machine**, validate the safety of their plays, and copy them with capital-compounding precision.

## ‚öôÔ∏è HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS ‚Äî IN REAL TIME

### 1. **Preload Elite Wallets**
- Token deployers of all coins that did 100x+ on OKX in the last 30 days
- Wallets that aped into tokens before 20x+ pumps in 12 hours
- Wallets clustered by behavior (signature, LP timing, chain ID)
- Stored in `data/real_elite_wallets.json` with stats like average multiplier, recent activity, win rate

### 2. **Real-Time Mempool Monitoring**
- Opens WebSocket to Ethereum mainnet
- Listens to all `pendingTransactions`
- Filters to only transactions from your alpha wallet list
- Decodes each transaction:
  - Is it a new token deployment?
  - Is it a buy via OKX DEX's router smart contract?

### 3. **Token Safety Analysis**
- Contract verification on Etherscan
- Bytecode analysis for anti-sell, blacklist, rebase, cooldown logic
- Ownership renouncement check (`owner()` = 0x0 or dead)
- Minimum $50K liquidity on OKX DEX
- Transfer function validation

### 4. **Real-Time Trade Execution**
- Mirror the smart wallet's buy within seconds
- Strict position sizing (30% of current capital)
- Priority gas to avoid being second in line
- Execute via OKX DEX API with live funds

### 5. **Automated Exit Strategy**
- 5x multiplier ‚Üí auto-sell
- Smart wallet exits ‚Üí you exit
- 80% loss ‚Üí stop loss
- 24-hour time limit ‚Üí forced exit

## üí∞ PATH TO $1M

| Trade | Entry | Exit | Capital |
|-------|-------|------|---------|
| 1 | $1K ‚Üí buy at launch | 10x | $10K |
| 2 | $10K ‚Üí mirror alpha buy | 10x | $100K |
| 3 | $100K ‚Üí next launch | 10x | **$1M** |

You only need **three well-timed 10x trades** or **five 4x trades**. This happens **multiple times daily on OKX DEX** ‚Äî if you enter at the same time as the creator.
