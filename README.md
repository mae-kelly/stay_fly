# 🧠 Elite Alpha Mirror Bot

**Turn $1K into $1M by mirroring elite wallet trades in real-time**

## ⚡ Core Strategy

Mirror trades from elite wallets (deployers + snipers) on OKX DEX within seconds of their actions, but with full safety validation.

### 🎯 What Makes This Elite

- **Real-time mempool monitoring** in Rust for maximum speed
- **Auto-discovery of 100x+ token deployers** from last 30 days
- **Multi-layer security analysis** before any trade execution
- **Capital compounding** - roll profits into next alpha play
- **Sub-second execution** to enter same block as smart money

### 💰 Compounding Math

Just need **3 well-timed 10x trades**:
- Trade 1: $1K → $10K (10x)
- Trade 2: $10K → $100K (10x) 
- Trade 3: $100K → $1M (10x)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
./deploy.sh
# Update config.env with your API keys
./start.sh
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
rust/           # High-performance mempool monitoring
python/okx/     # OKX DEX integration
python/analysis/# Token security + wallet tracking
core/          # Main orchestrator
data/          # Alpha wallet database
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Discover elite wallets** from recent 100x+ tokens
2. **Monitor mempool** for their transactions via WebSocket
3. **Analyze token safety** (honeypot, ownership, liquidity)
4. **Mirror their trades** within seconds on OKX DEX
5. **Auto-exit** at target multiplier or when they sell

## 🔐 Safety Features

- Contract verification checks
- Honeypot detection
- Ownership renunciation validation
- Liquidity analysis
- Trade simulation before execution
- Maximum risk per trade (30% of capital)

## 📊 Performance Tracking

- Real-time P&L monitoring
- Wallet success rate analytics
- Trade execution latency metrics
- Capital growth progression
